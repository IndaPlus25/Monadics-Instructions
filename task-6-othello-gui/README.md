# DD1337 Week 5

## Chess GUI Project

Great job creating your first ever Othello-engine! Now that you are a certified backend-developer, it's time to find out how much you'll like (or dislike) being a front-end developer ;) This weeks task is to create a GUI for a engine.

To write a front-end, you can chose whatever you want, but there aren't that many so here are two choices:

* [Gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) (recommended), check out the [template!](./gloss-template/)
* [GTK4](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gtk4)
* Whatever library you can find!

Take inspiration from existing games or go crazy and write something unorthodox!

### Requirements

#### Must haves

* You must be able to play the game
* You must be able to restart the game

#### Nice to haves

* Using someone else's engine
* Put your own spin on it! Have fun!

### Prepare assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-othello-gui` under the `IndaPlus25` organisation and clone it.
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and initialize your project.

See the template crate for help with code setup.

#### Chess GUI template

Navigate in your command prompt/terminal to the gloss template folder. Run the application to show an Othello board.

To switch from the incomplete `gloss-template` engine repository as a dependency, to one of your comrades' state of the art creations, just paste the code under `app/`. The project configuration file is already reading from it.
