Submission for task 2 Inda regular-+ group by sssuresh 

In this repo, my submission of task 2 is present. I did the 'summera tal' problem on Kattis.

## Check for code
In order to check the code, go to the 'summera tal' folder. There, a .hs file will be found with the code as well as the proof of submission on Kattis taken through a screenshot. 


## Thoughts
Overall, the task was fairly simple. However, it took time to understand the concepts and how each line of code prepared for the next one and the overall setup.
