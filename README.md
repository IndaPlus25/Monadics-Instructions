# Monadics-Instructions

This is for storing instructions for the plus assignments.

## Important

* Please name your repos correctly (``<KTH-ID>-<task name>``), it makes grading easier. E.g. ``kemstedt-haskell-intro``
* Read the [styleguide](STYLEGUIDE.md) for other important information.
* Getting a pass on these plus assignments does not require a perfect solution, but some time invested and a reasonable attempt is expected.
* It is always possible to do the week's regular assignment instead but beware that the grading is stricter in that case. Notify your asse/TA if you are doing the regular assignment so he/she knows what to grade.
